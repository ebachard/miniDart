All the files in this directory come in fact from ImGui, and include the changes Omar Cornut did,
and I found it more easy to separate them from other imgui_*. They all are used in miniDart without any modification,
just to fit what ImGui expects (miniDart deeply relies on Dear Imgui for the GUI). All the files mentionned above are
licensed both under Public Domain License, and MIT license (please verify reading them)
