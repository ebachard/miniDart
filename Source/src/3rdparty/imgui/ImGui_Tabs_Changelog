eric bachard : imgui_tabs.cpp + imgui_tabs.h

Resync'ed the code with Dear ImGui 1.61 WIP
Added IMGUI_VERSION_160_OR_MINUX GUARD for old code
Simplified the interface :
-removed :ImGuiUserCol_TabHover, ImGuiUserCol_TabTitleTextNormal, ImGuiUserCol_TabTitleTextSelected,
- now using ImGui themes
- added StyleColorsLightGreen() theme, since it is miniDart legacy theme
- removed duplicated code
Tested ok using miniDart
The code builds OK when cross-compiling (target : Windows7+ 64 and 32 bits)
